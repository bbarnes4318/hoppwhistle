Summary: Everything You Need
I've created 3 documents for you:

1. Deployment Workflow (
.agent/workflows/deploy.md
)
Type /deploy in any AI conversation and it will read this workflow
Contains step-by-step instructions with "turbo" annotations so safe commands auto-run
This is the workflow file - the AI will follow it when you use /deploy
2. AI Context Prompt (
docs/AI_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md
)
Copy and paste this at the START of any new conversation
Gives the AI full context about your project architecture
Explains the critical database limitation (can't reach from local)
Includes common fixes and production standards
3. Quick Reference Card (
docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md
)
One-page cheat sheet for you personally
Common commands copy-paste ready
TL;DR - The Key Things to Know
Fact	Value
Server SSH	ssh root@45.32.213.201
Project Path	/opt/hopwhistle
Compose Dir	/opt/hopwhistle/infra/docker/
Rebuild Command	docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build --force-recreate api web
DB is NOT public	Prisma commands MUST run inside container
Prisma as root	docker exec -u 0 hopwhistle-api npx prisma generate
Fix Redis	docker network connect --alias redis docker_default hopwhistle-redis-1
How to Use for Next Time
Start a new AI conversation
Paste the contents of 
docs/AI_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md
 at the beginning
State your task clearly
When ready to deploy, type /deploy and the AI will follow the workflow
The AI will now understand that it can't run Prisma locally and will give you proper SSH commands!
